<h1 id="troubleshooting-pbp-problems"># Troubleshooting PBP
problems</h1>
<h2 id="preface">## Preface</h2>
<p>I'm addressing common problem with the pbp more than anything. Go
down the list until you find something that's relevant to you.</p>
<h2 id="powerkey-shuts-off-machine">## Powerkey shuts off machine</h2>
<p>The powerkey is not in the most ideal locations. Edit
/etc/systemd/logind.conf and change "HandlePowerKey=poweroff" to
"HandlePowerKey=ignore"</p>
<h2 id="cant-boot-at-all-after-flashing-emmc">## Can't boot at all after
flashing EMMC</h2>
<p>You could either use an emmc to usb adapter to reflash your EMMC
(LAME). You could use your official pine64 UART cable to see if you
could fix the problem that way (EH). The third option is that you
carefully remove the pinebooks back plate with the display opened. It's
important to open the display before removing the back panel to prevent
the flimsy plastic or chassis from cracking (yup, that could happen).
Once opened, flip the emmc switch to disable the emmc (<a
href="https://wiki.pine64.org/wiki/Pinebook_Pro#Key_Internal_Parts">reference</a>).
With the laptop still open, begin the booting from your microsd. Once
you see the LED turn green, quickly flip the switch to turn on the emmc
again. Since the EMMC is not present, the pinebook first boots from the
micro-sd. Our goal is to turn on the EMMC early on in the kernel's boot
up phase, so this way the emmc gets recognized. If you flip the switch
to late, the EMMC will not appear as a drive. Once booted, you could
either reflash a new pinebook image or remove the bootloader from the
emmc.</p>
<h2 id="removing-the-bootloader">## Removing the bootloader</h2>
<p>Uboot resides within the first 35 or so megabytes of the drive. This
is why you end up seeing free space preceding the boot partition of your
drive. Without this free space, uboot would be overwriting your
bootfiles, so it's important you add it if you're ever doing any manual
partitioning (i.e installing Gentoo). I'm including two methods. The
first blindly overwrites the beginning of the drive - potentially
damaging the boot partition. The second specifically removes the parts
of the drive containing uboot, keeping your boot parition safe. If you
don't care about being able to boot from the emmc, use the first
method.</p>
<pre class="shell"><code># I forgot how many megabytes of space uboot takes
# Method 1 (destructive...maybe)
dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/BLKDEV bs=1M count=35 conv=fsync

# Method 2 (non-destructive)
dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/BLKDEV bs=32k seek=1 conv=fsync &amp;&gt;/dev/null
dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/BLKDEV bs=64k seek=128 conv=fsync &amp;&gt;/dev/null
dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/BLKDEV bs=64k seek=192 conv=fsync &amp;&gt;/dev/null
</code></pre>
<h2 id="loose-screws-that-fall-out">## Loose screws that fall out</h2>
<p>Some people reported that their screws to the bottom plate would fall
out after sometime. I've never experienced this, but I still took the
liberty of preventing it from happening. Go to the auto parts section of
any store and get yourself either low strength or medium strength
threadlocker. Avoid getting high strength threadlocker since you
obviously still want to be able to easily unscrew them in the future.
Add that to your Pinebook Pro's screws and you're good to go. I used
Permatex Threadlocker Blue (Medium Strength) 24200 which I bought from
Walmart. It works just fine.</p>
<h2 id="blinking-red-light-and-not-booting">## Blinking red light and
not booting</h2>
<p>Pretty sure this is indicative of a kernel panic. Nothing will be
displayed on the screen. The only way to tell what's going on is to use
the UART cable for the pinebook pro. Buy it if you don't have it. It's
useful.</p>
<h2 id="damaged-thermal-pad.-getting-a-replacement.">## Damaged thermal
pad. Getting a replacement.</h2>
<p>Purchase yourself a 4mm thermal pad from Amazon and you'll be all
set. Cut a 1 inch by 1 inch square.</p>
