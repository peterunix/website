* Running commands in parallel

** Preface
I found a tool called "parallel" that lets you run commands in parallel
instead of sequentially.

** Usage
The three colons get substituted for the arguments received from stdin.
The "-j" option denotes how many individual processes will be created.

#+begin_src
apt install parallel

# Recursivley search for all zip files and unzip four at a time
find -name "*.zip" | parallel -j 4 unzip ::: -d ./extracted/

# Run multiple grep commands on several files
find -name "*.txt" | parallel -j 8 grep -i "parallel" :::
#+end_src

GNU parallel can take stdin from a file aswell.
You won't have to worry about parallel creating two different processes which act on the same file
An example would be "grep" being run on "file.txt" twice.

#+begin_src
# Example of how parallel would work
find .
file.zip
something.zip
three.zip
four.zip

# Running two instances of unzip at a time
find . | parallel -j2 unzip :::

PROCESS1: unzip file.zip
PROCESS2: unzip something.zip
#+end_src
