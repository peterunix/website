* Setting up NFS share in Debain Linux
** Dependencies
#+begin_src shell
apt install nfs-kernel portmap
#+end_src

** Generating share
Edit /etc/exports

#+begin_src shell
/media/nfs              192.168.1.0/24(rw,sync,no_subtree_check)
/media/nfs              192.168.1.112(rw,sync,no_subtree_check) 192.168.1.121(ro,sync,no_subtree_check)
#+end_src

ro: Specifies that the directory may only be mounted as read only

rw: Grants both read and write permissions on the directory

no_root_squash: Root squash is an extremely dangerous option that allows remote “root” users the same privilege as the “root” user of the host machine

subtree_check: In the case of a directory being exported instead of an entire filesystem, the host should verify the location of files and directories on the host filesystem

no_subtree_check: Specifies that the host should not check the location of the files being accessed withing the host filesystem

sync: This just ensures that the host keeps any changes uploaded to the shared directory in sync

async: Ignores synchronization checks in favor of increased speed

#+begin_src shell
systemctl restart nfs-kernel-server
#+end_src
