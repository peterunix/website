* Custom keymap and font in TTY
** Preface
Generating a custom keymap in the TTY as well as setting a custom font.
I'll be setting the caps and menu key as a CTRL modifier.

** Custom keymap TTY
*** Dependencies
 Console-data contains (amongst other things) a collection of keymaps. We'll copy the us qwerty keymap, modify it, then load it.
 
 #+begin_src shell
 sudo apt install console-common console-data
 #+end_src
*** Copying the US qwerty keymap
 We'll edit this file later.
 
 #+begin_src shell
 zcat /usr/share/keymaps/i386/qwerty/us.kmap.gz > us.kmap
 #+end_src
*** Listing keycode of a keypress
 Run /showkey/ to display the keycode for each key you press.
 Wait 10 seconds without pressing a single key to exit the program.
 
 Here's the output when I press the Caps and Menu key:
 
 #+begin_src shell
 keycode 58 press
 keycode 58 release
 keycode 127 press
 keycode 127 release
 #+end_src
*** Modifying the keymap
 Edit the us.kmap file we copied.
 
 I searched for the keycode for the Caps key and changed the value to Control
 
 #+begin_src shell
 # Original caps key
 keycode 58 = Caps
 
 # Modified
 keycode 58 = Control
 #+end_src
 
 The keycode 127 wasn't listed so I appended it to the bottom of the file:
 
 #+begin_src shell
 keycode 127 = Control
 #+end_src
 
** Custom font TTY
Edit /etc/default/console-setup and modify the following variables:

#+begin_src shell
FONTFACE="TerminessTTF Nerd Font Mono"
FONTSIZE="24x12"
#+end_src

The font will be loaded upon reboot.
