** ## What is Xperf
The "Event Tracing for Windows (ETW).
A lot of OS components are instrumented using the ETW framework.

We can take advantage of ETW to log events for process and thread creation events, I/O events, context switch events, etc.

A short ETW trace session will log thousands of events. 

XPerf can manage settings used during an ETW trace session and visualize trace logs, 

** ## General Logman
logman.exe create counter Dell-Perf-Log -o “C:\perflogs\performancelog” -f bincirc -v mmddhhmm -max 800 -c “\PhysicalDisk(*)\*” “\Memory\*” “\Network Interface(*)\*” “\Process(*)\*” “\Processor\*” -si 00:00:01
logman start Performance_Logs
logman stop Performance_Logs
relog C:\Perflogs\Admin\Performance_Logs_000001.blg /o C:\Perflogs\Admin\Reduced_Log.csv /f csv

** ## XPerf installation
XPerf comes with the Windows Performance Toolkit (WPT).
You can download WPT from the Windows Software Development Kit (SDK)
https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/windows-sdk/
XPerf.exe will automatically get placed in the systems path after the installation.

** ## Sysport
@echo off
ECHO These commands will enable tracing:
@echo on
logman create trace "storport" -ow -o c:\perflogs\storport.etl -p "Microsoft-Windows-StorPort" 0xffffffffffffffff 0xff -nb 16 16 -bs 1024 -mode Circular -f bincirc -max 4096 -ets
@echo off
echo
ECHO Reproduce your issue and enter any key to stop tracing
@echo on
pause
logman stop "storport" -ets

@echo off
echo Tracing has been captured and saved successfully at c:\perflogs\storport.etl
pause
** ## Use XPerf. Large file
Let's create a large file thats 500MB in size.

#+begin_src powershell
fsutil file createnew large_file.txt 500000000
#+end_src

Opening up the file in notepad.exe can take several seconds.
We need to figure out what's taxing the system to figure out which trace events
we should log. I'm using the Resource Monitor "resmon.exe" for this.

After identifying where the bottle neck is (i.e CPU contention, disk contention, etc), we can capture the ETW stack-walk events to see where the overtaxxed resources are being used.
